# DiceChain - Decentralized Dice Roll Game

**DiceChain** is a decentralized blockchain-based game where players participate in a dice roll game to earn rewards. Players use **TheUnlimitedCoin (TUC)** to join the game and win exciting prizes. The game mechanics are powered by smart contracts deployed on the **Neo X Testnet T4**, with **GAS** as the network currency.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players guess the dice roll outcome and participate in the game.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Game logic is secured via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Token Rewards**: Players earn **TUC** tokens for correct guesses.
- **Decentralized Operations**: All transactions and game operations are transparent and stored immutably on the blockchain.

## Contract Details
- **Coin Name**: GAS (used for transaction fees)
- **Token Name**: TheUnlimitedCoin (TUC)
- **Network**: Neo X Testnet T4

## How It Works
1. **Entry Fee**: Players pay an entry fee of **1 TUC** to participate.
2. **Gameplay**: Players guess the outcome of the dice roll (a number between 1 and 6).
3. **Winning Rewards**: Winners are rewarded with **2 TUC** tokens.
4. **Frontend Integration**: Players claim rewards directly through the frontend, interacting with the TUC token smart contract.

## How to Play
1. **Connect Wallet**: Use a compatible wallet like NeoLine or O3 to connect to the application.
2. **Pay Entry Fee**: Deduct 1 TUC from your wallet to start the game.
3. **Make a Guess**: Predict the dice roll outcome by selecting a number between 1 and 6.
4. **Claim Rewards**: Winners automatically receive **2 TUC** tokens credited to their wallet.
