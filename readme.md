# DiceChain - Decentralized Dice Roll Game

**DiceChain** is a decentralized blockchain-based game where players can participate in a dice roll game and earn rewards. Players use **TheUnlimitedCoin (TUC)** to participate in the game and win rewards. The game mechanics are powered by smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess the dice roll outcome and participate in the game.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Game logic secured via a smart contract.
- **Token Rewards**: Earn **TUC** tokens for correct guesses.
- **Decentralized**: All game operations are transparent and stored on the blockchain.

## Contract Details
- **Token Name**: TheUnlimitedCoin (TUC)
- **Network**: Ethereum Testnet (Mantle Sepolia)

## How It Works
1. **Entry Fee**: Players pay an entry fee of **1 TUC** to start the game.
2. **Gameplay**: Players guess the outcome of the dice roll (1 to 6).
3. **Winning Rewards**: Winners receive **2 TUC** tokens as a reward.
4. **Frontend Integration**: Tokens are claimed directly from the frontend through the TUC token smart contract.

## Frontend
The game interface is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, providing an engaging and interactive experience for players. It connects to the blockchain using **web3.js** to interact with the smart contract.

## How to Play
1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask to connect your wallet to the application.
